            <h1> About </h1>
            <h5> Developer<span> &Designer</span></h5>
            <p> I am Sai Joshi, Developer, Designer and founder of the Royal-Tea and it's website.
                This website is created for my university assignment of Internet Technology where every
                student must create any kind of website using own creativity. So, I created an  website using 
                my own creativity.This is the best I did in minimal time.<br>
                Talking about the website,<br>
                It is an simple website of my company Royal-Tea. Here, people can see what we offer.Unfortunately people cannot 
                place an order directly from the website but we are working on deleivery project and hopefully we will launch this feature next month. Please do visit us and taste our tea spending quality times with your friends,family and all. Till Then stay safe.
                <br>
                The main motive of this business
                is to provide authentic and herbal rich tea in minimal cost.
